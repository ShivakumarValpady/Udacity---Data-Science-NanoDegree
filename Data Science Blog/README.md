# Airbnb Analysis for Seattle and Boston Cities 

## Motivation
This is the forst project of the Data Science Nandegree Program where in I have chosen 2 Airbnb Datasets of Seattle and Boston cities and made analysis of the datasets and answer some questions using the data available. A blog was published on the medium with link :

## Dependencies: 
- Python 3.6
- pandas 0.23.3
- numpy 1.12.1
- seaborn
## Contents : 
1) Airbnb Analysis.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook where all the code and analysis are present.
2) listings_boston.csv - Dataset in .csv format for Boston city.
3) listings_seattle.csv - Dataset in .csv format for Seattle city.

## Summary of my Findings:
1) The average price of Airbnbs in Boston is higher than that of the Seattle by almost 45$.
2) We see that for both Seattle and Boston Dataset, the location of the Airbnb matters the most. For some of the selected locations, the effects on the prices are high.

Apart from the Locations, the other top two factors which increases the prices are no. of bedrooms and bathrooms. While, the features shared room and private rooms are least opted by customers and the effect these have a negative impact on the prices.

One more trend we see that, even though number of Airbnb rooms are more in some places in both Bostona nnd Seattle, the effect they have on prices are not high. This suggests that, higher number of rooms are present in an average priced localities.

3) For both the cities, we see that the prices increase when they have TV, Air Conditioning, Kitchen and the rooms are family Friendly. The other factors do not contribute much to the increse of price of Airbnbs.
